This component identifies if someone is using different names to trick the system into believing they are different people!
Api end points for below functional usages
- Receives and stores a person
- Calculates the probability that 2 persons are the same physical person.

A person is represented by the following attributes:
- First name
- Last name
- Date of birth (can be unknown)
- Identification number (can be unknown)

The matching logic should work in the following way:
- If the Identification number matches then 100%
- Otherwise:
	If the last name is the same +40%
	If the first name is the same +20%
	If the first name is similar +15% (see examples)
	If the date of birth matches + 40%
	If the dates of birth are known and not the same, there is no match

Similar first names examples:
- Andrew and A. (initials)
- Andrew and Andew (typo)
- Andrew and Andy (diminutive)
